    <h1 id="subtitle" class="page2">Tactics of the war</h1>
    <p class="page2" id="pmed">the first world war saw extensive use of attrition and trench warfare, though tactics on the field shifted as new technology and doctrines became realities. Mouse over some common tactics below to read more about them.</p>

        <h1>Trench Warfare</h1>
        <img class="entrenchimage" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Aerial_view_Loos-Hulluch_trench_system_July_1917.jpg/960px-Aerial_view_Loos-Hulluch_trench_system_July_1917.jpg" alt="no image displayed">
        <p class="entrenchtext">Trench warfare was a defensive military tactic characterized by opposing armies digging extensive trench systems to protect soldiers from enemy fire and hold territory. These trenches included front-line positions, support trenches, and communication trenches, allowing troops and supplies to move while minimizing exposure. Battles typically involved prolonged artillery bombardments, raids, and limited attacks rather than rapid advances, resulting in a deadly stalemate. While trenches reduced casualties from small-arms fire, they created harsh living conditions and made breaking through enemy lines extremely difficult, shaping much of the strategy and suffering of World War I.</p>

        <p class="otttext">“Over the top” attacks were a common World War I infantry tactic in which soldiers climbed out of their trenches and advanced across no man’s land toward enemy positions. These assaults were usually preceded by heavy artillery bombardments intended to destroy defenses and cut barbed wire, but the bombardments often failed to fully neutralize enemy machine guns. As a result, advancing troops were exposed to intense fire, leading to extremely high casualties and limited territorial gains. Although the tactic reflected commanders’ early beliefs in massed infantry assaults, its repeated failures highlighted the need for new strategies and better coordination of weapons on the battlefield.</p>

        <p class="barragetext">Artillery tactics in World War I focused on using sustained and coordinated bombardments to weaken enemy defenses and support infantry advances. Early in the war, long preliminary barrages attempted to destroy trenches, barbed wire, and morale, but they often warned defenders of impending attacks. As tactics evolved, armies developed creeping barrages, in which artillery fire moved forward in timed stages just ahead of advancing infantry, providing continuous cover and suppressing enemy machine guns. Stepping barrages were similar but advanced in larger jumps, pausing to allow infantry to regroup before the fire shifted forward again. These methods improved coordination between artillery and soldiers and made attacks more effective, highlighting artillery’s central role in World War I combat.</p>

        <p class="miningtext">Mining tactics in World War I involved digging underground tunnels beneath enemy trenches to plant large explosives aimed at destroying defensive positions and breaking stalemates. Specialized tunneling units worked in secrecy, often in dangerous conditions, while listening for enemy countermining efforts below ground. When detonated, mines could obliterate trenches, create massive craters, and kill large numbers of soldiers instantly, as seen in battles like Messines Ridge. Although mining could achieve dramatic local successes, it was slow, resource-intensive, and limited in strategic impact, adding another deadly and psychological dimension to trench warfare.</p>

        <h1>Trench Raiding</h1>

        <p class="raidingtext">Trench raiding was a tactical method used in World War I to harass enemy forces, gather intelligence, and weaken morale through small, surprise attacks rather than full-scale assaults. Raids were usually carried out at night by specially trained troops who crossed no man’s land to infiltrate enemy trenches using grenades, knives, and close-quarters combat. These operations were extremely dangerous and often resulted in high casualties despite their limited scale. The Germans refined this approach through their stormtrooper divisions, which emphasized speed, surprise, and infiltration tactics, influencing later developments in modern infantry warfare.</p>

        <p class="didtext">Defense in depth was a World War I tactic that involved organizing multiple layers of defensive positions rather than relying on a single front-line trench. Instead of concentrating all troops at the front, defenders spread forces across forward positions, support trenches, and strongpoints further back, allowing them to absorb attacks and counterattack effectively. This system reduced the impact of enemy artillery bombardments and made breakthroughs harder to exploit, as attacking forces were slowed and weakened at each defensive layer. Widely adopted by the Germans later in the war, defense in depth helped limit losses and increased the resilience of trench systems.</p>
