    <h1 id="subtitle" class="page2">Tactics of the war</h1>
    <p class="page2" id="pmed">the first world war saw extensive use of attrition and trench warfare, though tactics on the field shifted as new technology and doctrines became realities. Mouse over some common tactics below to read more about them.</p>

        <h1>Trench Warfare</h1>

        <p class="entrenchtext">throughout the war, both sides participated in trench warfare. trench warfare consisted of long static lines of trenches and bunkers spanning the entire front. typically, both sides would establish trench lines simultaneously, resulting in the formation of a "no man's land". these were large stretches of land between trenches where any troops crossing would be fully exposed to enemy fire.</p>

        <h1 id="ot1">Over The Top</h1>

        <p class="otttext">often the most commonly represented tactic in media, over the top was a brutally simple tactic: send troops across no man's land in a large wave to overwhelm enemy trenches. during a charge, soldiers would be fully exposed to enemy fire and often required to carry up to 60lbs of extra gear to set up defenses once the trenches were captured. this tectic left soldiers fully exposed and had a very high casualty rate, often requiring 60% more soldiers than the enemy had defending per wave.</p>

    <div id="barrage">
        <h1>Artillery</h1>

        <p class="barragetext">artillery tactics evolved a lot over the war. typically a battery consisted of 4 artillery pieces, and any number of batteries could be assigned to the front. </p>
