        <div class="weapong"><p>Tanks in World War I were a new and experimental technology developed primarily to break the stalemate of trench warfare, as traditional infantry assaults were devastated by machine guns, barbed wire, and artillery. First used by the British at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, early tanks were slow, mechanically unreliable, and difficult to maneuver, but their armored protection allowed them to cross trenches and suppress enemy positions. Despite frequent breakdowns and limited tactical understanding, tanks had a strong psychological impact on enemy troops and demonstrated their potential as a decisive weapon. By the end of the war, Britain and France had improved tank designs and coordination with infantry, laying the foundation for modern armored warfare.</p></div>

        <div class="weapong"><p>Artillery was the most dominant and destructive weapon of World War I, responsible for the majority of battlefield casualties and shaping the nature of trench warfare. Massive artillery barrages were used to soften enemy defenses before infantry attacks, destroy barbed wire, and demoralize opposing forces, though they often failed to eliminate well-protected troops in deep trenches. Advances in heavy guns, high-explosive shells, and indirect fire allowed artillery to strike targets miles away with devastating effect. The constant shelling transformed battlefields into cratered landscapes and contributed to severe psychological trauma among soldiers, while improved techniques such as creeping barrages and better coordination with infantry made artillery increasingly effective as the war progressed.</p></div>

        <div class="weapong"><p>Poison gas was a terrifying new weapon introduced during World War I, first used on a large scale by Germany in 1915 to break the deadlock of trench warfare. Gases such as chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas caused choking, blindness, severe burns, and long-term health damage, spreading fear as much as physical harm. Although gas attacks were often unpredictable due to shifting winds and weather, they forced armies to develop gas masks and protective gear, changing how soldiers operated on the battlefield. While gas rarely achieved decisive breakthroughs, its psychological impact was profound, leading to international condemnation and postwar efforts to ban chemical weapons.</p></div>

    <div class="weaponsgrid">
        <div class="weapong"><p>Guns, especially machine guns, were central to the devastation of World War I and played a major role in creating the deadly stalemate of trench warfare. Bolt-action rifles were standard issue for infantry, but rapid-fire machine guns could fire hundreds of rounds per minute, allowing small defensive units to cut down advancing soldiers with devastating efficiency. Positioned in fortified emplacements, machine guns made frontal assaults extremely costly and forced armies to dig extensive trench systems for protection. As the war progressed, improvements in tactics, lighter machine guns, and better coordination with artillery and infantry attempted to overcome their defensive dominance, but guns remained one of the war’s most lethal technologies.</p></div>
