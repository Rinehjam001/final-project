    <p style="font-size: 200%; color: white;">the war was brutal. commanders still believed that war was honourable, and that one decisive battle would determine the war. hundreds of thousands of men were sent to die in the name of glory without changing lines an inch. month long battles would be fought over capturing a structure that would be destroyed by the time of success. conditions on both sides were hellish, only worsened with the advent of gas attacks. the conflict brought terror and ruin across europe, entire cities turned to rubble by the march of war. the cost was unfathomable and on a scale never before seen.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 200%; color: white;">soldiers called nurses "mother" out of instinct from fear and pain, some troops were executed for supposed cowardice as they became shell shocked, battle lines got younger and younger as the war raged, but the brutality only got worse.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 100%; color: white; font-style: italic;">"we had to give some of the soldiers soda instead of alcohol, they were still too young for that"</p>
